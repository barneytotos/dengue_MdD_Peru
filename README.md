# Modeling dengue in Madre de Dios (MdD), Peru
This repository contains R and stan code for a model focused on understanding the drivers of dengue transmission in MdD in order to predict how proposed development plans could affect dengue transmission in the future. 
This dengue model is a component of a larger collaborative Sustainable Development project in Peru (https://www.facebook.com/proagua.natcap.cincia/community/?ref=page_internal); Stanford's involvement funded by the Moore Foundation (https://www.moore.org/). 
The overall goals of this collaborative endeavor were to: 
  1) demonstrate the benefits of ecosystem services and watershed management for the health and well-being of the growing population in Madre de Dios, Peru (MdD); 
  2) Predict the effects of proposed development plans on these ecosystem services. Results from other aspects of this grant are available here (http://viz.naturalcapitalproject.org/pro-agua/).

A report using less technical language is available (in Spanish) here ( ). 
More complete methods and extended discussion about the data and models are available here ( ).

To run these models open top_level_script.R and follow the directions
