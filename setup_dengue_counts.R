## Denuge counts setup 
#####

## First load the data, and add dengue cases to each pop by finding the matching pop center where
 ## dengue cases were taken. Requires some matching (nearest neighbor in QGIS). 72 of 87 locations have
  ## the same named population center and most are within 1.5km

## Why pop buffer entries are duplicated I have no idea, came that way
pop_buffer   <- pop_buffer %>% filter(!is.na(X))

pop_buffer   <- transform(pop_buffer, NOMBRE_COM = as.character(NOMBRE_COM))
dengue_cases <- transform(dengue_cases, NOMBRE = as.character(NOMBRE))

names(pop_buffer)[2]   <- "pop_name"
names(dengue_cases)[3] <- "dengue_name"

#### !*! 
## This is potentially a dangerous choice: the closest hospital for some of these places
## is outside of MdD, and  we don't have data from those hospitals. In an infectious individual went
## outside of MdD for treatment, they will turn up as a 0 in the dengue count dataset
